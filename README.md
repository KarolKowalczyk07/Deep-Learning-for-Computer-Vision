# Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
Different tasks/homeworks used to learn how deep learning is used for modern computer vision problems, based on Columbia's COMSW4732, Computer Vision II: Learning
These tasks include: aligning channels of an image to produce a colored image, image processing (eg. denoising, mean filtering, gaussian filtering, convolutions, edge detection, laplacian filters, hybrid images, fourier transforms, low and high pass filters),
Neural Networks and their functions (eg. forwards, backwards, batch sampling, updating parameters, and loss functions), and object recognition using a residual network (ResNet).
